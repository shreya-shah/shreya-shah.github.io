                    Amidst the fierce battle during dusk and dawn, or whether its a storm with hefty rains the nature's wrath or be it the humans,
                    the ardour and valour never did dwindle away, even when plunged in cannon smoke.

                    Tripped over the tattered lone shoe ; half under the ground and also the remains. Still would kneel down cover them with
                    the violets of pride.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And then the relentless pelting did hurt but wouldn't refrain from succouring those in the affray . oft would see blood spilt
                    all o'er , the air seems still, reeking of sadness and gunpowder; the shoulder of which hung low, having
                    the weight of those vanishing in trench from the ground, with deep a stain. With sorrows such that even
                    death may cry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The bruises and wounds itched the eyes, brought up the dried tears questioning-after all this ,final exit only lies? There
                    might be roars of life and the barking of death. But not the sword did she have but a hand to alleviate.

                    not with a knife, bringing them back from the shrieking iron and the burning flames, not to live but
                    to give their mothers a reason to live their life.

                <p class="first-para last-para">
                    Each evening, shortly after sunset, darkness covers the land. Having mystified thinkers for millennia, the mechanism for
                    this occurrence has now been identified: migration. Darkness, it has been found, is composed of an almost
                    infinite number of particles, which roost and reproduce up north where they have fewer natural enemies:
                    Forest fires, lampposts, lasers, blazing sunlight, torches, candles, lighthouses, limelight, and electricity
                    are relatively rare in the polar regions.

                    In the cooling weather, With clasping arms and cautioning lips, With tingling cheeks and finger tips.
                    “Lie close,” Laura said, Pricking up her golden head: “We must not look at goblin men, We must not buy
                    their fruits: Who knows upon what soil they fed Their hungry thirsty roots?” “Come buy,” call the goblins
